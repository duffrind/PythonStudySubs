# PythonStudySubs
Simplified, lightweight StudySubs app for offline use.

For the full experience, please visit http://studysubs.com/

This was created due to requests for a localized version of app.

Current bugs:
* Does not respond well to non-dictionary form verbs and adjectives because I switched from mecab to tinysegmenter to reduce dependencies
  * NOTE: The online version handles them fine
